If a valid authentication response is delivered from Google, the app takes the user's information and calls the Google Analytics Management API. With this request, the app checks if a particular authenticated user has valid permissions to access the Google Analytics Reporting API data.</p>",

Once this data is sent back to the client it is then processed using Plotly.JS, a free open source interactive javascript graphing library. Plotly.js is built on d3.js and webgl and supports over 20 types of interactive charts.</p>",
